# Old Piston Sounds!
Old piston sounds is a mod, which brings back the old, pre 1.14 piston sounds
There may be some issues still, but remember this is not bringing back the old sound engine, just a simulation of the old sounds.

Commands:
`/oldpistons cutoffPistons [true/false]` Either says the current state (no arguments given) or changes the value<br>
`/oldpistons changePistonPitch [true/false]` Either says the current state or changes the value<br>
`/oldpistons cutoffSmoothLastPiston [true/false` Changes if it should simulate the smooth piston sound after a clock stops running.<br>
`/oldpistons pistonSoundThreshold [int]` Changes the amount of pistons that have to fire in the same gametick to cut out.<br>
`/oldpistons cutoffTime [int]` Changes how long it should wait before cutting out. (It is recommended to leave this below 3 as 3 will cull almost all piston sounds)<br>




(dw Matt didnt do anything)
