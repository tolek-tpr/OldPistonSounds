# Old Piston Sounds!
Old piston sounds is a mod, which brings back the old, pre 1.14 piston sounds
There may be some issues still, but remember this is not bringing back the old sound engine, just a simulation of the old sounds.

Commands:
`/oldpistons cutoffPistons [true/false]` Either says the current state (no arguments given) or changes the value
`/oldpistons changePistonPitch [true/false]` Either says the current state or changes the value

(dw Matt didnt do anything)
